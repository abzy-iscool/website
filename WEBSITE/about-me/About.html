      <strong>
        Hey there! allow me introduce myself my name is Abhishek Jani i am 16 years old and im trying to make it as a
        fullstack developer
        i started getting into computers when i was 13 and 3-years later here i am making my own website i can still
        remember when i thought
        using the command line on windows was the coolest thing ever maybe i had too much of fun with technology anyway
        disregard that as
        i went off track okay the thing is that i love exploring the world of code and logic i love making and bulding
        new things i have alot to learn
        of corse but that doesnt mean a novice like me cant try...atleast i think point is that this website is here for
        the soul reason to help build
        my skills im using freelancing as medium to do that therefore dear reader should you have any inquires about
        buildng something cool it could be anything
        about the WEB please PLEASE fill out the <a
          href="/home/abzycadabzy/Desktop/WEBSITE /contact-me/contact.html">contact</a> me form i would love to work on

      <strong>
        As where I would see my self in another 10yrs to come would be in the technology industry but not as a full time
        developer but rather an I.T
        GURU the first stance i would take before reching this stage would be exploring all sorts of
        harware,software,hacking tools/techniques to try and build a deeper understanding of how logic and reasoning
        works with a computer
        as i really want to emphasize how curious i am about computers and making and breaking them
        finally after all of the milestones i hit i would be done with the tech world and this is where i would try and
        break through the market with the meta of that time or if not create the meta for that time.
